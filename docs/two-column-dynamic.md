## 🧠 How It Works

- All edits are saved in `localStorage` under the key: `tamer-resume-data`.
- On page load, saved data is restored automatically.
- No backend is required – everything works client-side.

---

## 🖨️ Print Output

- Use the 🖨️ “Print Page” button to print.
- Elements marked with `.no-print` will not appear in the print view.
- Layout avoids breaking sections across pages using `break-inside: avoid`.

## 💡 Tips

- To reuse this template for another person, duplicate the folder and customize the contents.
- You can export the resume as PDF using the browser’s built-in print-to-PDF.
- Use 🧹 “Reset” to clear all edits and start fresh.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- Editing is enabled via `contenteditable` and `prompt()` dialogs.
- Consider enhancing the editing UX with modal forms or rich text editors.
- Multilingual support can be added via `lang` attributes and i18n-compatible keys.
